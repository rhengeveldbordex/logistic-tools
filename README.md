# Logistics Toolbox Repository

This is a repository containing useful code snippets for logistics applications. The code snippets can be used to perform various logistics calculations and solve problems. One of the tools in this repository is a function called `calculate_pallets`, which calculates the number of pallets needed based on the given packages and pallet dimensions.

## Installation

To use the code snippets from this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/rhengeveldbordex/logistics-toolbox.git

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
cd logistics-toolbox


3. The code can be executed using a Python interpreter. Make sure Python is installed on your system.

## Functions

### `calculate_pallets(packages, pallet_length, pallet_width, pallet_height)`

This function calculates the number of pallets needed based on the given packages and pallet dimensions. It takes the following parameters:

- `packages`: A list of dictionaries representing each package. Each package in the list should contain the keys "length", "width", "height", and "quantity". The values of these keys should be numeric.
- `pallet_length`: The length of the pallet (numeric).
- `pallet_width`: The width of the pallet (numeric).
- `pallet_height`: The height of the pallet (numeric).

The function returns the number of pallets required to accommodate all the packages. The number of pallets is rounded up using the `math.ceil()` function.

#### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `calculate_pallets` function:

```python
packages = [
 {"length": 10, "width": 10, "height": 10, "quantity": 2},
 {"length": 20, "width": 20, "height": 10, "quantity": 5},
 {"length": 30, "width": 10, "height": 10, "quantity": 3},
]
pallet_length = 100
pallet_width = 100
pallet_height = 120

num_pallets = calculate_pallets(packages, pallet_length, pallet_width, pallet_height)
print("Number of pallets needed:", num_pallets)
```

This will produce the following output:
```python
Number of pallets needed: 4
```
This means that 4 pallets are required to accommodate all the packages according to the given dimensions.
